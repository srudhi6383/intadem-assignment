# Pin Drop with Remarks

A React-based web application that allows users to drop pins on a map, add remarks, and fetch addresses based on latitude and longitude. The application persists pin data using localStorage, and saved pins are viewable in a sidebar list for easy navigation.

# Features

- **Pin Drop**: Click anywhere on the map to drop a pin, enter remarks, and submit.
- **Address Fetching**: Automatically fetches the address using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
- **Pin List**: View all saved pins in a sidebar with remarks and addresses.
- **Pin Navigation**: Click on a saved pin to navigate to it on the map.
- **Local Storage**: Pins, remarks, and addresses are persisted across sessions using browser localStorage.

# Tech Stack
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Leaflet.js**: Open-source JavaScript library for maps.
- **React Leaflet**: A React wrapper for Leaflet.
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim API**: For reverse geocoding (converting latitude and longitude to addresses).
